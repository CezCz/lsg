The Polish Summer Go Camp is one of the biggest Go events in Europe. It has quite a different schedule and attractions then the EGC. Your strength is not important. We have teachers for dan players as well as for beginners and children. And of course there's a tsumego competition. Lessons are normally in Polish, but we aren't afraid to switch to English!

There's a beautiful lake to swim in, forests to stroll in, horses to ride, and beers to drink. You can sleep in your tent, military tents, or in a cottage. The camp provides an almost-modern kitchen, a big barn rebuilt to a general meeting place and dancing room, clean toilets, showers, audio and karaoke hardware, parking. You can also [see some photos](https://facebook.com/pg/przystanek.alaska.5/photos/).
